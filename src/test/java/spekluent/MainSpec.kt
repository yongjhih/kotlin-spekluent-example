            |Existing computer programs that measure readability are based largely upon subroutines which estimate number of syllables,
            |usually by counting vowels.
            |The shortcoming in estimating syllables is that it necessitates keypunching the prose into the computer.
            |There is no need to estimate syllables since word length in letters is a better predictor of readability than word length in syllables.
            |Therefore,
            |a new readability formula was computed that has for its predictors letters per 100 words and sentences per 100 words.
            |Both predictors can be counted by an optical scanning device,
            |and thus the formula makes it economically feasible for an organization such as the U.S.
            |Office of Education to calibrate the readability of all textbooks for the public school system.
